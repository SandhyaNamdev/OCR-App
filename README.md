
# OCR Application

## Overview

This Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application is designed to convert images containing text into machine-readable text. It utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to accurately recognize and extract text from various image formats.

## Features

- **Image Input**: Supports multiple image formats including JPEG, PNG, and BMP.
- **Text Extraction**: Accurately extracts text from images using state-of-the-art OCR algorithms.
- **Multi-language Support**: Recognizes text in various languages.
- **User -friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation.
- **Export Options**: Allows users to save extracted text in different formats (TXT, PDF, etc.).

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - `opencv-python`
  - `pytesseract`
  - `Pillow`
  - `Flask` (for web interface, if applicable)
  
You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pytesseract Pillow Flask
```
